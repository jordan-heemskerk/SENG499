## Introduction
This repository serves as the home for the course [SENG 499](http://www.ece.uvic.ca/~elec499/) offered at the University of Victoria in the Summer of 2016. The proposed project is to implement a system capabale of generating and continuously updating triangular meshes through the use of a RGBD camera, such as the Microsoft Kinect. Similar work has been done in the following papers.
* [KinectFusion: Real-Time Dense Surface Mapping and Tracking](http://homes.cs.washington.edu/~newcombe/papers/newcombe_etal_ismar2011.pdf)
* [DynamicFusion: Reconstruction and Tracking of Non-rigid Scenes in Real-Time](http://grail.cs.washington.edu/projects/dynamicfusion/papers/DynamicFusion.pdf)
